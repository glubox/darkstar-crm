# darkstar-crm
This is a simple CRM system implementation with C# and SQL server to be used as demo for demonstrating unit, integration, UI and System tests using different frameworks.

The goal is to start simple and lean with the most basic entities and later over complicate it based on imagined sales VS marketing fight. At all times ensure a perfect test pyramid and full code covarage.
